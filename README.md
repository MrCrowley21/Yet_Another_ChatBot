# ✨Yet Another ChatBot ✨

<p align="justify">
This repository contains a simple chatbot application developed using <strong>Streamlit</strong> for 
the user interface and <strong>LangChain</strong> as the framework to manage interactions with the 
LLM. The chatbot provides real-time, dynamic responses using <strong>OpenAI’s GPT models</strong> and 
<strong>Google Search Engine</strong> for up-to-date information retrieval. 
<strong>LangSmith</strong> is integrated to monitor and analyze the chatbot’s performance in 
production, helping to track conversation flows and detect potential issues.

## Why LangChain? 🤔 
<p align="justify">
<strong>LangChain</strong> is a framework that simplifies the process of building applications 
powered by LLMs. It provides tools to streamline development, maintenance, and 
monitoring.

* **LangChain** - integrates easily with APIs, including those for LLMs and external 
tools like search engines.
* **LangGraph** - helps define conversation flows and decision-making processes, 
improving chatbot performance by boosting responses with the latest data from web 
searches. It also supports seamless response streaming.
* **LangSmith** - simplifies monitoring and logging by tracking all interactions 
between the LLM and connected tools, helping debug and optimize performance efficiently.
